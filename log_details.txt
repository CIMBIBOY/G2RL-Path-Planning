1.	Learning Rate (learning_rate):
	•	What it logs: The current learning rate used by the optimizer.
	•	Interpretation: This value controls how much the model’s parameters are adjusted with respect to the gradient. In many training setups, the learning rate might be annealed (reduced) over time.
	•	Good Value: Depends on the problem, but a common strategy is to start with a higher learning rate and reduce it as training progresses. A learning rate that is too high might lead to unstable training, while one that is too low might result in slow learning.
2.	Value Loss (value_loss):
	•	What it logs: The loss related to the value function (i.e., how well the agent is predicting the value of states).
	•	Interpretation: The value function estimates the expected return (future rewards) from a given state. A high value loss might indicate that the model is struggling to predict these returns accurately.
	•	Good Value: Ideally, this should decrease over time as the model learns better state-value estimates.
3.	Policy Loss (policy_loss):
	•	What it logs: The loss related to the policy (i.e., how well the agent is learning to choose actions).
	•	Interpretation: This loss guides the agent in improving its actions to maximize cumulative rewards. A high policy loss might indicate issues with the policy network or the exploration-exploitation balance.
	•	Good Value: Similar to value loss, this should generally decrease over time as the policy improves, though fluctuations can occur.
4.	Entropy Loss (entropy_loss):
	•	What it logs: The entropy of the policy, which measures the randomness of the action selection.
	•	Interpretation: Higher entropy indicates more exploration, while lower entropy suggests more exploitation. Maintaining a balance is crucial.
	•	Good Value: You want this to be high initially (indicating exploration) and decrease over time as the policy becomes more confident in choosing actions.
5.	Old Approx KL (old_approx_kl) and Approx KL (approx_kl):
	•	What it logs: The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the old policy and the new policy.
	•	Interpretation: KL divergence measures how much the policy has changed during an update. High KL values may indicate large, potentially destabilizing policy updates.
	•	Good Value: Should be small, indicating that updates to the policy are not too drastic. Some RL algorithms (like PPO) specifically control for this to avoid large policy shifts.
6.	Clip Fraction (clipfrac):
	•	What it logs: The fraction of updates where the policy change was clipped.
	•	Interpretation: This is relevant in algorithms like PPO, which use clipping to prevent large updates to the policy. A high clip fraction indicates that many updates were large enough to require clipping.
	•	Good Value: Should be small to moderate, indicating that the policy updates are under control.
7.	Explained Variance (explained_variance):
	•	What it logs: The proportion of the variance in the returns that is predictable from the value estimates.
	•	Interpretation: This metric indicates how well the value function is explaining the variability in the returns. A higher value is better.
	•	Good Value: Values close to 1 are good, indicating that the value function is explaining most of the variance in returns. Negative values suggest poor performance.
8.	Steps Per Second (SPS):
	•	What it logs: The number of environment steps processed per second.
	•	Interpretation: This measures the speed of training. Higher values indicate faster training, which is generally desirable.
	•	Good Value: Depends on the computational resources and environment complexity, but higher is better for efficiency.
9.	Termination Causes (Reached goals, Lost guidance information, Max steps reached, Collisions with obstacles):
	•	What it logs: Counts or averages of specific termination conditions in the environment.
	•	Interpretation: These metrics track how episodes are ending, which can give insights into the agent’s behavior and learning progress.
	•	Good Value: Ideally, you’d want more terminations due to “Reached goals” and fewer due to “Lost guidance information”, “Max steps reached”, or “Collisions with obstacles”.
10.	Current Max Dynamic Objects (Current max dynamic objects):
	•	What it logs: The current number of dynamic objects in the environment, typically increasing as the agent learns.
	•	Interpretation: This is related to the curriculum learning strategy where the environment’s difficulty increases as the agent improves.
	•	Good Value: Should increase over time, indicating that the agent is handling more complex scenarios.
11.	Global Steps (Global Steps):
	•	What it logs: The total number of steps taken across all environments.
	•	Interpretation: A measure of how far along training has progressed.
	•	Good Value: More steps generally correlate with more training, but efficiency in learning is also crucial.
